**For this project, I used the AES-256 encryption method.**  

**This mini project is built in Python, using the pycryptodome package, which includes Crypto.Cipher and Crypto.Random.**  

**I am learning every day about how encryption works, so the script might be modified in the future.**  

**If there are any bugs or mistakes, please let me know. I would be happy to learn and improve.**  

**Thanks!**
